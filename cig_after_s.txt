0,Don't Let Me Go,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566939/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Don%27t+Let+Me+Go,"When I was young, I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded and I never saw you again
But I won't forget the love we had

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so

When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
And though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
And my heart goes
Out to you
Wherever you are

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so"
1,Kiss It Off Me,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566938/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Kiss+It+Off+Me,"Saw you on the side of the road
I could see you walkin' slow
Drinkin' a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap
Fallin' in my lap
You were so thirsty

Could you love me instead
Of all the boyfriends you got?
Know I make you forget
About all of those rich fuckboys

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly
And your peach baseball cap
Is tossed under the rack
Of clothes and your jewelry

And you beg for it
In the morning again
Before you go to the gym 
Said it's a bad habit
You just can't quit

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me"
2,Heavenly,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566937/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Heavenly,"Wanting your love to come into me
Feeling it slow, over this dream
Touch me with a kiss
Touch me with a kiss

Now you're above feeling it still
Tell me it's love, tell me it's real
Touch me with a kiss
Feel me on your lips

'Cause this is where I wanna be
Where it's so sweet and heavenly

I'm giving you all my
Giving you all my
Giving you all my love
Giving you all my
Giving you all my
Giving you all my love
All my love

3,You're the Only Good Thing in My Life,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566936/Cigarettes+After+Sex/You%27re+the+Only+Good+Thing+in+My+Life,"You only f*ck for love
Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You could be my Penthouse Pet, I know

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off

Everything is wrong, but it's alright
Everything is wrong, but it's alright
You're the only good thing in my life

Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
Shouldn't have a care left in the world
Naked, tanning by the swimming pool

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off

Everything is wrong, but it's alright
Everything is wrong, but it's alright
You're the only good thing in my life

Laying in the sun
Never need to tell me when you come
'Cause you know that I can just feel it"
4,Touch,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566935/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Touch,"Oh, I missed you and I cried
But I said that I was alright
And I know it's been a while
Since I needed a distraction

'Cause I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

And I watched you do a line
That you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired
I just wanna see you upside down

I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I listen to you cry all night
Through the telephone

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

Couldn't say you didn't want me there
When we were lyin' in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
I was hurting so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love"
5,Hentai,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566934/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Hentai,"There was a hentai video that I saw
I told you about the night that we first made love
About a girl who, as soon as she made you come
Would show you the future and tell you your fortune

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash
Over the ocean, thought it was romantic
But you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, ah
Thinking of me dead is making you feel bad

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you"
6,Cry,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566933/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Cry,"It's making you cry every time
You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait for me to stay
I know it hurts you

But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good, wish that I could
Give you my love now

But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry"
7,Falling In Love,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566932/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Falling+In+Love,"When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
And last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, ""All that I want is to be yours""

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
And holding my hand for the whole thing

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart"
8,Pure,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566931/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Pure,"When you walk in the room
In a white bodysuit
And I say, ""Take it off""
So you tell me to watch

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful

And the TV is on
When we make love, because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful

Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth

And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful"
9,Falling In Love,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36574535/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Falling+In+Love,"When I hold you close to me

11,Crush,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35132373/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Crush,"I wanna line my walls with photographs you sent
Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed
Can’t live without your love inside me now
I’ll find a way to slip into your skin somehow

I wanna f*ck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here my loveliest friend

I love to watch you when you’re trying on your clothes 
And now you’re all I think about when I’m alone
Can’t wait to feel your love inside me now
We’ll have a drink or two and we’ll go to your house

I wanna f*ck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here my loveliest friend

I wanna f*ck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here my loveliest friend
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here my loveliest friend"
12,Neon Moon,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35792839/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Neon+Moon,"When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world, turns blue

There's a rundown bar
'Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
Close my eyes
Sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
You'll come back one day

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

But I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon
And I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon"
13,Apocalypse,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33830218/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Apocalypse,"You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Your lips, my lips, apocalypse
Your lips, my lips, apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees, oh please
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Oh, when you're all alone, I will reach for you
When you're feeling low, I will be there, too"
14,K.,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941157/Cigarettes+After+Sex/K.,"I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And on the Lower East Side you're dancing with me now
And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me
And no one else

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle

And I'm kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And it's just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me I don't want you to leave

Kristen, come right back
I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle"
15,Each Time You Fall in Love,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941158/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Each+Time+You+Fall+in+Love,"Each time you fall in love
It’s clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn’t safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it’s worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn’t real

She took you for a ride in summer baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in

Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It’s clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn’t safe

She took you for a ride in summer baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in"
16,Sunsetz,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941159/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Sunsetz,"Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear-view

Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view"

I'm a flash, the light could only get in through the cracks

And you've gotta do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

When they crashed the helicopters in my heart, it ripped
Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

And you had to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

Now I stand on the stage
I forget my lines to your play ""Satan's Imagination""
And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph"
19,Sweet,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941162/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Sweet,"Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you

It's so sweet"
20,Opera House,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941163/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Opera+House,"Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage, singing with my eyes closed
I've got a love for you I just can't escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight"
21,Truly,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941164/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Truly,"Sitting out smoking in the garden of the apartment
I reached down to grab your hand and kissed it when you weren't looking
Ooh, you're on the sheets like it's a dirty magazine
And I like the way you say exactly what you mean

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me

Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there
And your lips are red and all the pictures that you send
Wearing white or black, all leading up to when we met

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me
Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me"
22,John Wayne,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33941165/Cigarettes+After+Sex/John+Wayne,"He's got so much love for her
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside of school

He's in for a heartbreak if it's all been blind faith
From my point of view

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room

He's always feeling cheated, telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy"

Put on your socks
Cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs
And your ""I Love New York"" shirt

Well, I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

You wanna go where the girls are young and dumb
And hot as f*ck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
You showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby

My heart is racing watching you kiss him
On my guitar
Faking the teardrop by spraying my eye with
That water gun

Well, I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

We wanna go where the girls are young and dumb

When they crashed the helicopters in my heart, it ripped
Cut in half, you saw me lying there bleeding to death

And you had to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph

Now I stand on the stage
I forget my lines to your play ""Satan's Imagination""
And a voice in my head's causing suicide searching for any way to remember them

And you've got to do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing, do the right thing, baby
You're the white swan in the photograph"

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it

And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life

Holding you until you fall asleep

It’s clearly not enough
You sleep all day and drive out in L.A
It isn’t safe
And each time you kiss a girl
You never know what it’s worth
You say all of the words they wanna hear
It isn’t real

She took you for a ride in summer baby
Lost all your money to her
All I wanna know is if you love her
How come you never give in

Each time you have a dream
You never know what it means
You see that open road and never know which way to go
And each time you fall in love
It’s clearly not enough

We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away 
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear-view

Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away 
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view"

Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

Your lips, my lips, apocalypse
Your lips, my lips, apocalypse
Go and sneak us through the rivers flood is rising up on your knees, oh please
Come out and haunt me, I know you want me
Come out and haunt me

Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

Got the music in you baby, tell me why
Got the music in you baby, tell me why
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye
You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye

To be in love to make love to me

Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there
And your lips are red and all the pictures that you send
Wearing white or black, all leading up to when we met

To be in love to make love to me"

Always ends in a hazy shower scene

Some sort of roller coaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies

And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips

Waterfalls, I'm jumping down

I know you're leaving, baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die"

But none of them matter to me except you

I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

Hidden underneath your bed
I’ve seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You’ve ever been with

You’ve had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I’ve had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling

As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
I was hurting so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine

What can I do for your attention

When I'm alone I hear and feel you
Wish that I could reach right out and touch you
But knowing you're the one to greet me, and meet me
Two alone in the dark, may it be

Starry eyes
The sparks will fall on me
Starry eyes
Won't you listen that I'm here being
For you, starry eyes
Starry eyes forever
Shall be mine

Starry eyes forever

57,You're All I Want,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/37170136/Cigarettes+After+Sex/You%27re+All+I+Want,"You would use your songs to say
The words you couldn't say
And every word you sang
Was about you and me
I loved
Everything you wrote, and when
You would sing, I felt
That my heart was falling

You're all I want
We fucked so hard, it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love
It's only yours

You're all I want
All the love

And with
Cristal and pink champagne
On our wedding day
You had a Hollywood
Sign made of cocaine
For us
Then you got on top of it
And you sang to me
As the snow was falling

You're all I want
We fucked so hard, it left me faded
For all you are
There is no other love
It's only yours

You're all I want
All the love"
58,Opera House,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36729999/Cigarettes+After+Sex/Opera+House,"Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage, singing with my eyes closed
I've got a love for you I just can't escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

If I abandoned love, I'd be a man without dreams (ooh)
I'd rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight

Ooh, I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh, I was meant to love you

It faded and I never saw you again
But I won't forget the love we had

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side
Don't let me go
Stay with me still
I've missed you so

When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away
And though I guess it had to come to an end
No one else could have the love we shared

Come to me now
Don't let me go
Stay by my side

Out to you
Wherever you are

I could see you walkin' slow
Drinkin' a Slurpee
In a peach baseball cap
Fallin' in my lap
You were so thirsty

Could you love me instead
Of all the boyfriends you got?
Know I make you forget
About all of those rich fuckboys

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly
And your peach baseball cap
Is tossed under the rack
Of clothes and your jewelry

And you beg for it
In the morning again
Before you go to the gym 
Said it's a bad habit
You just can't quit

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me

Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me
If you're gonna break my heart
This is a good start
Kiss it off me"

Told me you could never get enough
Posing as a Playboy centerfold
You could be my Penthouse Pet, I know

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off

Everything is wrong, but it's alright
Everything is wrong, but it's alright
You're the only good thing in my life

Do what your heart desires
Love is always strange when it just starts
Shouldn't have a care left in the world
Naked, tanning by the swimming pool

You make me think of
Storms on the beaches
With all the lights off

Everything is wrong, but it's alright
Everything is wrong, but it's alright
You're the only good thing in my life

Laying in the sun
Never need to tell me when you come
'Cause you know that I can just feel it"

I could always see a house by the ocean
And last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, ""All that I want is to be yours""

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
And holding my hand for the whole thing

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before with you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart"

Put on your socks
Cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs
And your ""I Love New York"" shirt

Well, I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

You wanna go where the girls are young and dumb
And hot as f*ck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
You showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby

My heart is racing watching you kiss him
On my guitar
Faking the teardrop by spraying my eye with
That water gun

Well, I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

We wanna go where the girls are young and dumb
And hot as f*ck
Where they're dancing in the streets
With nothing on
I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat

I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby"

We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away 
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear-view

Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away 
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view"

And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

Want you, yes, I do
Bet you never knew it
Think you'd suit me fine
Want you all the time

And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you
And now I'm dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of you

And when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

And the TV is on
When we make love, because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

When it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
When it's deep
Gets so hot and it's so beautiful

Wrapped your hair in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth

And we stare at the street
From the back balcony

Is you undressing for me

I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

And I watched you do a line
That you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired
I just wanna see you upside down

I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I listen to you cry all night
Through the telephone

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

Couldn't say you didn't want me there
When we were lyin' in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
I was hurting so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough

And there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

That's called the Falling Angel
It's an amusement park ride
Some sort of roller coaster
It takes you up and when it brings you down
It gives you butterflies

And now I'm longing for your kiss
Bet you could read it on my lips

Waterfalls, I'm jumping down

I know you're leaving, baby
The birds are flying south
And there's nothing to say
I need you here
I need your love inside of mine like I could die"

And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash
Over the ocean, thought it was romantic
But you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, ah
Thinking of me dead is making you feel bad

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes

And I like the way you say exactly what you mean

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me

Said you wear a new perfume for each city that you visit
So you can always remember how it felt to be there
And your lips are red and all the pictures that you send
Wearing white or black, all leading up to when we met

Truly, know that you really don't need

Truly, know that you really don't need
To be in love to make love to me"

You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under

It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet

And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you

Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet"
