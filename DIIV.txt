0,Horsehead,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566183/DIIV/Horsehead,"I've seen the middle of
Five foot airtight walls and
I've told the setting sun a joke
You laughed his head right off

Horsehead
It's never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out
Horsehead
I'm never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out

(?)

I sat in a slump so my shadow
Sat slumped too
Then I laid among the rocks and stones
F*ck it all

Horsehead
It's never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out
Horsehead
I'm never quite enough
I wanna breathe in
And never breathe back out

Wake up, throw it all away
Nothing's changed, nothing changes
Wake up, throw it all away
Everything is nothing anyway

We're each the rotten squall
At the center of it all
We're each the rotten squall
At the center of it all
We're each"
1,Like Before You Were Born,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566182/DIIV/Like+Before+You+Were+Born,"The wind fans deadpan
We plummet through the wake
Well, that's my last mistake
Birds land then
Stand and fly astray
They'd do that anyway

It's just
Like before you were born
Through that peaceful moment
Like before you were born
Like before you were born
Like before you were born

I'm an old man
I tell the same old sun
""I get it, I've done it, I'm done""
Cars breeze past
Winding through the calm
I guess their lives go on

It's just
Like before you were born
Through that peaceful moment
Like before you were born
Like before you were born
Like before you were born"
2,Skin Game,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566181/DIIV/Skin+Game,"One afterthought on a skin game
I took it as prescribed
Vow do no harm, buy the cure
But first you'll buy the disease

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

Well, what you want?
""Serve me""
Sell me to the spoon
I'm cashing in, falling out
Tear me down, hang me up
Strung out to please the king
In metropolitan's sackler wing
I can help you
It's how I help myself

I can see you've had some struggles lately
Hey man, I've had mine too

Fighting to get through the door
But I can't live like this anymore
They gave us wings to fly
But then they took away the sky

I wanna be your doll
But I won't be your dog anymore
You gave us wings to fly
But then you took away the sky

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in you

Holding in coughs, hiding my head
Everybody respects the dead
I can help you
It's how I help myself

Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin
We live to use and we use to live
Crack a window
Get some life in me"
3,Between Tides,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566180/DIIV/Between+Tides,"On and on, the clock was wrong
You've been numb so long
His words, they lapped an endless rote
It's gonna rain, build a boat

On masterstrokes of ebb and flow
Down the drain the current flows
All along the alpenglow
It seems my pain was self-imposed

I'm just waiting for the storm to die out, out
I'm just waiting for the storm to die out
I'm just waiting for the storm to die

On and on, in memory
You'll have my company
Mountain building, anodynes
Both in handfuls at a time

I asked the trees why they grow
They said, ""It's all we know""
I apologize to all I see
For everything I used to be

On and on, the clock was slow
Down the drain, we surely know
How to drink the oceans up
Better start with a cup

I'm just waiting for the storm to die out"
4,Taker,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566179/DIIV/Taker,"You watched my lips make
The promise I betrayed
The years I lived in vain
Chasing the pain with pain

Stand down
There's oil in my name
My tongue flickers like a wilting flame

Lay it all out
The path of wreckage that I cut
All in want of what?
Who were you to believe?
Your lying eyes or me?
I won't let them tie to you
The shit I put you through

Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
Stand down

Stand down
There's oil in my name
My tongue flickers like a wilting flame

Lay it all out
The path of wreckage that I cut
All in want of what?

Stand down
Stand down
Stand down
Stand down"
5,For the Guilty,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566178/DIIV/For+the+Guilty,"Love revenge
Love redemption
Rise and fall
Start and stall

Cash and prizes
You heard them say
Are for the guilty
And stay that way
But how are you today?

Curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
I was a stranger in my skin
In my skin

Old friends
Consequences
Forgive yourself
Starting now

No matter how
Things may change
Don't turn away
You're present now
But the past is in your blood

(I've been)
Curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
I was a stranger in my skin

Curtained in with arms outspread
I was a stranger in our bed
Shut away and getting thin
We were both strangers in our skin
In our skin"
6,Lorelei,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566176/DIIV/Lorelei,"Dog-star, ram, and pomegranate
Fox swam and swans descant
Entranced in an awful dance
For Lorelei

For Lorelei

For Lorelei

Pine box or mantle top
Circe's humdrum song
Is pleading for help at my
Overcoat of clay

Forget my youthful sins
Lay waste to my transgressions
Scream that melody in vain
My Lorelei

My Lorelei"
7,Blankenship,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566175/DIIV/Blankenship,"Armageddon is a product
And one we choose to buy
Dwell on that for a moment
With paradise on fire

I guess it's all the way
Blankenship 
Children lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship 
With thirty years of lies
Ooh
Ooh

Who sold us the dominion
Over swine that smell their knife?
The vicious creature thin and dying
On a scrap of melting ice

The Earth is ownerless
Blankenship
Children lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With thirty years of lies

I should have treated you better
Blankenship
The lives you weaponize
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With silver-plated eyes
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Think of your sons and daughters
Laid in ashen water
Sirens louder and louder
Destroy those who destroy the Earth

Ooh
Ooh"
8,Acheron,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36566174/DIIV/Acheron,"This heart-pounding day has finally arrived
All my living footfalls sigh like the night
Outside the war between illusion and truth
I found wisdom lain among putrid fruit
Of desperation, cold wild gift of youth
Urgent and dead-eyed
Urgent and dead-eyed

Hate the God
I don't believe in
Heaven's just a part of hell
Hate the one
Who wouldn't save us
Shikata ga nai

In the blue mist death has finally closed in
All my gasping words at war with the wind
Worshiping the fear of hell left me lost
I've found something for us souls who have crossed
Charon's torrent cold spiked black with frost
Ashen and dead-eyed
Ashen and dead-eyed

Hate the God
I don't believe in
Heaven's just a part of hell
Hate the one
Who wouldn't save us
Shikata ga nai

Nothing can be done
I'm no one

He's my blood
Reflected in mud
Leave my body
Among the poppies
I'm nailed to your flaws
You were my God"
9,Out of Mind,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524600/DIIV/Out+of+Mind,"Yeah out of sight
And out of mind
But everything I should do
Just comes so easily to you

You had me first
Our shadow thirst
When roles reverse
My mind rewinds and I see you

I'm out of signs
At the end of the line
But I'll be fine
When it's time I'll know what to do

The world was mine
But I'm too blind
I'll stay behind
And choose which scrap to start anew

I'm out of sight
Out of mind
I'm out of sight
Out of mind"
10,Under the Sun,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524599/DIIV/Under+the+Sun,"Yes, I'll come back to you
No, I won't ask where you run
Under the sun

Yes, I'll catch up to you
Then I'll ask, ""what have we done?""
Under the sun

To be free, be awake
Big breath that you can't fake
Once you've begun

Press my face to the back
All the pillars that stack
And hold up the sun

On the right side coming on the right time
On the right time coming on the right side"
11,Bent (Roi's Song),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524598/DIIV/Bent+%28Roi%27s+Song%29,"I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I left you with a very big mess then I watched it progress
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
And you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
And I saw you after a decent spell in a private hell
And I told you, ""I hope I live a thousand lives, hope I live them well""
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body's putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight

I saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
And I lost you when you said one hit couldn't hurt a bit
Took a little time for your trip but I saw you starting to slip
'Cause you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
I can't shake the terror of my life fleeting, minute by minute
Even when I can't imagine another day waking up in it
Fought my mind to keep my life, but my body's putting up a tougher fight
Yeah if it feels wrong, you can go on along
But once it feels right then you just lost the fight"
12,Dopamine,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524597/DIIV/Dopamine,"Shots ringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Crawling out from a spiral down
Fixing now to mix the white and brown
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I'm your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

Shots wringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Buried deep in a heroine sleep
Floating deeper underground
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I am your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

Would you give your 81st year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 60th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 45th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?
Would you give your 34th year
For a glimpse of heaven, now and here?

Shots ringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years started weighing me down
Crawling out from a spiral down
Fixing now to mix the white and brown
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I am your cloud
Burning down, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself

Shots wringing out, I'm soaking
Eardrums shaking, years start weighing me down
Buried deep in a heroine sleep
Floating deeper underground
Passing out, running in place
You're the sun and I am your cloud
Burning out, running in place
Got so high I finally felt like myself"
13,Blue Boredom (Sky's Song),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524596/DIIV/Blue+Boredom+%28Sky%27s+Song%29,"There's a crack
Reflective grass
Stone face
Mute glance
High black
In the back of
A normal joke
Easier to choke
Smile glue
Bad stick/bad fit
With you
A blanket curse
A made up bed that waits
In heaven
You have my face
My neck my waist
And a fucking saint
In a rocking chair
That stays in place
Thief for a chance
Kiss for a catch
Blue flower
Blue boredom
Did you know I colored in the clues
For you for you
They make a game
That spells your name
Fresh fear at the centerfold
Colored mess to backwards steps
Always taste
Like another face
Always smell
Like a kind of hell
Waterproof person to be
To be
Blood like soap
When water washes it thin
Washes it away to stay"
14,Valentine,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524595/DIIV/Valentine,"The right side of me
Is the right side of me
Burn it down and give it up
You never wanna give it up

Medicine for free
If you'd only asked for me
I'd be a better animal
In every other little way

Stuck inside of me
In tragedy I'm complete
Mother father daughter son
My Valentine my only one

Keep me in distant sight
Of when it's day and when it's night
And how many weeks have passed
And if I'm still who I was last"

16,Take Your Time,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524593/DIIV/Take+Your+Time,"Take your time, hear 'em out
How they went to go about to give it up and find yourself in time
Take your time, it's all about
The circle up to circle out what's in your mind, then take your time

Take your time, come about
Draw your flag and hand it out, then take a look and then hide it deep inside
Take your time, hear em out
It works if you work it out, to clean out your mind, and take your time"
17,Is the is Are,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524592/DIIV/Is+the+is+Are,"You ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes

Over my head and positive
I have a gift that I'll never give

You ain't the first
You ain't the first

Last time I walked down this street
I walked down this street
I wanted to die

Die

Now I'm fighting
I feel like I'm fighting
I feel like I'm
Fighting for my life

Life"
18,Mire (Grant's Song),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524591/DIIV/Mire+%28Grant%27s+Song%29,"I was blind, but now I see
You made a believer out of me

I was blind, but now I see
You made a river out of me

I was high, but now I feel low
My own private I dunno"
19,Incarnate Devil,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524590/DIIV/Incarnate+Devil,"It's today and it's in a word
I breathe and seethe
Fade to zero
I'm misinformed
I'm barely born
Gone to the void
With the incarnate devil and a talking snake

""Here in this spring storm, stars float along the void""

Here he comes
Today
It's written on my face
A clue
A tunnel you can look right through
It'll take
Some time in line
With the incarnate devil
And a talking snake"
20,Healthy Moon,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524588/DIIV/Healthy+Moon,"How could I describe
This fading dream?
You turned and looked a way
It goes around getting louder now
Believe it
Freezes love that way

Name the song and I'll
Just scream it
There's a
Dead moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeting
To crash into again

How could I describe
A long lost dream?
You turned and looked a way
I've lived ten lives and had ten loves
To remind me
What I've been guilty of

Say the song and I'll
Just scream
It there's a
Fucked moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeing
From the healthy moon"
21,Loose Ends,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524587/DIIV/Loose+Ends,"All our loose ends
Are gathered here inside this house
You left me here to sort them out

But its not all yours really
I kept a few to hold onto
I tied them to my wrists and you said:

""Does it feel watered down?""
""Does it feel over now?""

""Do you feel watered down?""
""Do you feel older now?""

You hated when I said
I needed anything, I didn't
So I walked into your room
And took it all"
22,Dust,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524585/DIIV/Dust,"The only way to be quiet is to be quick
A slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can't get sick
I'll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
Keep outta sight while my watch just ticks
I'm trying to keep quiet but I can't move quick
Drowning in air, light, floating up in flight
Then it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
You fall

I forced myself to be quiet just to be quick
Lead a slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can't get sick
I'll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
But now I'm fucked to die in a world of shit
I'm trying to keep quiet but I can't move quick
Wings matted with death spilled oil slick
Then it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
And you fall"
23,Waste of Breath,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32524584/DIIV/Waste+of+Breath,"It's no good

It would be a waste of breath to tell a man
That he's got something better to do

I forced myself to be quiet just to be quick
Lead a slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can't get sick
I'll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
But now I'm fucked to die in a world of shit
I'm trying to keep quiet but I can't move quick
Wings matted with death spilled oil slick
Then it gets too bright, and your body's a brick
And you fall"
38,Waste of Breath,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/32517636/DIIV/Waste+of+Breath,"It's no good
It would be a waste of breath to tell a man who believes in me
That he's got something better to do

It's no good
It would be a waste of breath to tell a man
That he's got something better to do

It's no good
It would be a waste of breath to tell the man in me
That he's got something better to do

It's no good
It would be a waste of breath to tell a man
That he's got something better to do"
39,Human,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28882660/DIIV/Human,"Sunrise waiting
I knew myself completely then nothing love though it hasn't said
Youth light fading.
I know myself as I was then birds sounding each shorter day in
Sun tries vainly
To stay lit for another day melts into darkness static state
Til young light waves in 
Drink the heat and climb and twist fawn looking for a friend to kiss."
40,Big Joke,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28882659/DIIV/Big+Joke,"Make me feel simple feelings
Let me feel simple feelings
Animal gestures
Animal gestures

Make me feel simple feelings
Let me feel simple feelings
Animal gestures
Animal gestures

Make me feel simple feelings
Let me feel simple feelings
Animal gestures
Animal gestures

I barely feel you breathing
Touch me
Animal gestures
Animal gestures

He's such an asshole
I want you all to say, ""Asshole"" really loud
Asshole!"
