42,Past Lives,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881659/DIIV/Past+Lives,"I was your home and you locked yourself outside and ran 
With your ghosts back to a place you’d already known. 
Nowhere to crawl but to your past life and hid from it 
All a buried flower convinced you’ll grow kept enough to 
Remind but stayed outside 

With nowhere to go. 

You left nowhere to go."
43,Human,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881658/DIIV/Human,"Sunrise waiting
I knew myself completely then nothing love though it hasn't said
Youth light fading.
I know myself as I was then birds sounding each shorter day in
Sun tries vainly
To stay lit for another day melts into darkness static state
Til young light waves in 
Drink the heat and climb and twist fawn looking for a friend to kiss."

Choke-clean cold to cool my thoughts away from you"

How long have you known?
How long has it shown?

Forever, if ever, at all?"
46,Wait,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881655/DIIV/Wait,"Innocent and late for love in your city
Weights above innocent and late for love in a city
I'd wait so long to feel you feel you here
Alone, yeah, I'll seep into your bones and innocently wait for love"
47,Earthboy,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881654/DIIV/Earthboy,"If I'm alone and you're free now we know nothing's ever meant to be
But come along with me and by my secret side that no one sees
I built a throne from a burden of need
Earth boy gets harvested or else recedes so while you're cold
Numb my dream and I'll chew rocks and splinters
Sob and scream earth boy on your throne
You sit alone"
48,Follow,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881652/DIIV/Follow,"Anything we should know about your change? 
Bleached black from the smile
On a glimpse of your face
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable date
You remember her

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
'Cause we're similar
I blame it on you
'Cause that side of me I hate
But you were never hurt

I'm putting it off
And I can't control fate
Yeah I ran to her
Blame it on me
That inevitable game
But you were never hurt"
49,Sometime,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881651/DIIV/Sometime,"Oh your body is a mess sometimes
Your brain is just a part of your head
It really is a mess sometimes
Your head is just a part of the rest

It's really necessary sometimes
Your birth is just a part of your death
That really isn't it this time
Your death is just a part of your

Oh your body is a mess sometimes 
Your brain is just a part of your head
It really is a mess sometimes
Your head is just a part of the rest

It's really necessary sometimes
Your birth is just a part of your death
That really isn't it this time
Your death is just a part of your"
50,Oshin (Subsume),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881650/DIIV/Oshin+%28Subsume%29,"Uh f*ck the world
Alien love
Pull me out in your flood
Uh f*ck the world
Alien love
Pull me out in your flood
Ah I let it rain

Drink from cup
Maybe raze pray for flood
Oshin crash salt makes blood
Red with clay
Black with mud
F*ck the world
Alien love"
51,Doused,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881649/DIIV/Doused,"Never had you run so far but you really gotta get away
You know it in the nighttime running to it
Caught a rising star but then you let it drop into
The ocean now the water's running through it
Now you've gone so far you really had to get away you
Knew it in your lifetime running to it
Acting like you've come so far the bed you made yourself
And this house and me are all falling apart

Never thought you'd go so far but now you're really
Gone and it's been so long I never really think about it
Yeah you made a beating heart whatever now that amber
Light has faded and it's yours to commit it
Act like it stops and starts a gesture here and there
For me is one thing but I felt it every time you blew it
Now you've gone too far your urge to run away is back and we all knew"
52,Home,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/28881648/DIIV/Home,"You'll never have a home

You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home until you go home

You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home until you go home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home
You'll never have a home until you go home"

57,The Spark,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1597680/DIIV/The+Spark,"Sit at the foot of my bed
She said like a ghost
Watch a boat in a cove
Lose hope, who knows?

Here there's a shadow
A girl in the shade
Wants to find someone
So what, who knows?

In our past
We were such a mess
We did our best
Only time will tell
It's our past
It's a wreck
We do our best
And the spark will glow

Sit at the foot of my bed
She said like a ghost
Watch a boat in a cove
Lose hope, who knows?

As summer fades
Waves carry
Your soft knowing gaze
Marigolds in a row
So what, who knows?

In our past
We were such a mess
We did our best
Only time will tell
It's our past
It's a wreck
We do our best
And the spark will glow

Letting go, the lines we tow
Surrender what we thought we know
Letting go, the lines we tow
Tending to the spark up close"
58,Blankenship,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric-lf/1591913/DIIV/Blankenship,"Armageddon is a product
And one we choose to buy
Dwell on that for a moment
With paradise on fire

I guess it's all the way
Blankenship 
Children lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship 
With thirty years of lies
Ooh
Ooh

Who sold us the dominion
Over swine that smell their knife?
The vicious creature thin and dying
On a scrap of melting ice

The Earth is ownerless
Blankenship
Children lead the cry
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With thirty years of lies

I should have treated you better
Blankenship
The lives you weaponize
You sold them all away
Blankenship
With silver-plated eyes
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Think of your sons and daughters
Laid in ashen water
Sirens louder and louder
Destroy those who destroy the Earth

Ooh
Ooh"
