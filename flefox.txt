0,Sun It Rises,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494744/Fleet+Foxes/Sun+It+Rises,"Red squirrel in the morning
Red squirrel in the evening
Red squirrel in the morning, I'm coming to take you home

The sun rises, over my head
In the morning, when I
Hold me dear, into the night
Sun it will rise soon in the falling

The sun rising, dangling there
Golden and fair, in the sky

Ooh, ooh"
1,Ragged Wood,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494742/Fleet+Foxes/Ragged+Wood,"Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us, follow my only song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning
You should come back home, back on your own now

The world is alive now, in and outside our home
You run through the forest, settle before the sun
Darling, I can barely remember you beside me
You should come back home, back on your own now

You should come back home, back on your own now

In the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide, when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Johnathan and Evelyn get tired

Lie to me if you will 
At the top of Beringer Hill
Tell me anything you want
Any old lie will do
Call me back to you

Back to you

Lie to me if you will 
At the top of Beringer Hill
Tell me anything you want
Any old lie will do
Call me back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you
Back to you"
2,Tiger Mountain Peasant Song,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494741/Fleet+Foxes/Tiger+Mountain+Peasant+Song,"Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go
Graceful in the morning light
To banner fair
To follow you softly
In the cold mountain air

Through the forest
Down to your grave
Where the birds wait
And the tall grasses wave
They do not
Know you anymore

More, more, more

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die
You tell me everything
Anything true

In the town one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see anybody that dear to me

Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die
You tell me everything
Anything true

Jesse
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon"

I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
For you to wear upon your fleeced down

My meadowlark sing to me

Hummingbird, just let me die
Inside the broken ovals of your olive eyes
I do believe you gave it your best try

My hummingbird sing to me,
My hummingbird sing to me

Don't believe a word that I haven't heard
Little children laughing at the boys and girl
The meadowlark singing to you each and everyday
The arc light on the hill side and the market in the hay"
6,Oliver James,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494734/Fleet+Foxes/Oliver+James,"On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear,
By the river bridge a cradle floating beside me.
In the whitest water on the banks against the stone
You will lift his body from the shore and bring him home

[Chorus]
Oliver James washed in the rain no longer
Oliver James washed in the rain no longer

On the kitchen table that your grandfather did make
You and your delicate way will slowly clean his fate
And you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of
A innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love

[Chorus]

Walk with me down the beach and through the valley floor
Love for the one you know more
Love for the one you know more

Back we go to your brother's house emptier my dear
The sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear

[Chorus]"
7,English House,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494731/Fleet+Foxes/English+House,"Go with your two feet bare
Down through the cold lane there, to Brighton.
A country house, a liar and a louse live there.

Go with your arms held wide.
Happiness in your eyes, come and sit.
And stay the night. Turn out of the light you see.
And lay them down buried in the ground for me.

Whoa my love, Whoa my love,
Whoa my love, Whoa my love,
Whoa...

Tongues in a creatures way.
Drawn to the fragile legs, you walk on.
A cold wind blows right into the coast for me.
The cold wind blows right into the coast for me.

Whoa my love, Oh my love,
Whoa my love, Oh my love,
Whoa my love, Oh my love,
Whoa my love, Oh my love,
Oh...

8,Icicle Tusk,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494723/Fleet+Foxes/Icicle+Tusk,"I'll shoot you dead for the father
Of the coal miner's daughter
Beneath the icicle tusk
You and me among the flattering dusk

In my haste I draw my weapon
Designing your final lesson
As you recede to the floor
All is silent but the fluttering door

Twenty-five grand on the table
Of the high wall street stable
I'm not responsible for
The reputation of the neighborhood whore

But I'm a keyhole peeker
And you're my surveillance keeper
And though my memory rusts
I will always see the icicle tusk

And I must admit
That it gets lonesome on my shelf
This much I can tell
This much I can tell"
9,Isles,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/35494719/Fleet+Foxes/Isles,"Everyone stares when you walk in the room
They stare when you go
You've got so much control
How could anyone say no?
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Caught in the light, you would idly spin
Your skeleton ring
See it shine when you sing
To the window with no meaning
From Tennessee your harmony
Would leave your spirit

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Silver the shores of isles up north
Boulevards of dancing boats

You keep the old ember burning
With meadows in mind
As the coaches go by
These thoughts of you will die
They rarely do
That's why you're you
And why you're winning

And I don't even miss you at all
No, no

Silver the shores of isles up north
Boulevards of dancing boats

Silver the shores of isles up north"

And I'll be till I'm through
And I'm light on my feet
Good to be without you
Distant light, distant dancer
Mute at midnight she might look like the answer
But I'm all that I need

So it's true, I've gone too far to find you
And the thumbprint scar I let define you
Was a myth I made you measure up to
It was all just water, winding by you
And the basking, gnashing, foaling, feeding
And the rising, falling, melting, freezing
And the raising for destroying feeling
(All we do, this repeats)
You've got all you need on me
And now I see that it's all corroding
Soonest seething, soonest folding
But the night won't last if you just hold fast, so calm down
(I'm hardly made of steel)
Tell me, are you so concealed?
(Can't I just go to sleep?)
You're no more so blind to me

Are you alone?
I don't believe you
Are you at home, I'll come right now
I need to see you
Thin as a shim and Scottish pale
Bright white light like a bridal veil
""I don't need you""
Cut to chewed through finger nails

I was a child in the ivy then
I never knew you, you knew me
Not like you knew me
Off on the other ocean now
All is behind you, all is sea"
22,Cassius,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832333/Fleet+Foxes/Cassius,"Past my window, out in the street
Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue, the useless sirens scream

The song of masses, passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire, blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I, out into the night
Held within the line that they've drawn

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Oh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son, and a daughter
Oh, are we also tamed?

I walked home, no words to say
Cassius, one month gone on his way
And who will lead us and who remains to die?
By a thread, drop my head to cry

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son, and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh"
23,"Naiads, Cassadies",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832332/Fleet+Foxes/Naiads%2C+Cassadies,"Who stole the life from you?
Who turned you so against you?
Who was the thief who shaved your teeth
Accepting just virtue
Ooh

And did he act alone?
Were any more complicit?
When he would sing and offer the ring
What older voice said, ""kiss it""?
Ooh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Fire can't doubt its heat
Water can't doubt its power
You're not adrift, you're not a gift
You know you're not a flower"
24,Kept Woman,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832331/Fleet+Foxes/Kept+Woman,"Anna, you're lost in a shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be bolder than me
I was high, I was unaware

God above saw, ever in the mind
Blue and white irises in a line
Under your nameless shame
I left you in frame, and you rose to be ossified
As a rose of the oceanside
Too long to the light of the morning
So unseen, as light in a dream
Too long now to the rising
Too long now to the rising

Can you be slow for a little while?
Widow your soul for another mile?
I'm just the same as when you saw me back then
And we're bound to be reconciled
And we're bound to be reconciled
Too long swinging in the night
All will wash over you in a night so unending
Not long now to the rising
Not long now to the rising

Anna, you're lost in the shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be bolder than me
I was high, I was unaware"
25,Third of May/Odaigahara,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832330/Fleet+Foxes/Third+of+May-Odaigahara,"Light ended the night, but the song remained
And I was hiding by the stair
Half here, half there, past the lashing rain
And as the sky would petal white, old innocent lies came to mind
As we stood, congregated, at the firing line

Night ended the fight, but the song remained
And so I headed to the wall
Turned tail to call to the new domain
As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free
But it's all the same
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow? 
Did you change overnight?
Second son, on the other line

Now, back in our town as a castaway
I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May
As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow? 
Did I change overnight?
Second son, for the second time

Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?

But all will fade
All I say
All I needed
As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded

Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it
And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it

I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing
Hold fast to the wing"
26,"If You Need To, Keep Time on Me",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832329/Fleet+Foxes/If+You+Need+To%2C+Keep+Time+on+Me,"How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what state is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes heatless fire

But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me"
27,Mearcstapa,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832328/Fleet+Foxes/Mearcstapa,"Two lines in the air
Two eyes on the pair
Mearcstapa, on an open sea
But you turn away
No falling today
No wind in the night
You're putting slack in the lines

The eyes of the sea
So easy to meet
Mearcstapa, deaf and blind like me
And the foam doesn't sing
The phone doesn't ring
So what will you find
Mearcstapa of mine?"
28,On Another Ocean (January/June),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832327/Fleet+Foxes/On+Another+Ocean+%28January-June%29,"Biding your time on the other ocean
Falling into line in the cold and damp

Wherever you run, you see all you leave behind you
Lies inside
Anyone you open on the other ocean
On the other ocean, on the other ocean

Was he not quite as you had conceived him?
Did the color of the light hide the fight in the eye?

Wherever you run, you see only eyes behind you
Lies inside
Anyone you open
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean

So, do you think the smoke, it won't enfold you?
Or there'll be someone waiting for you?
Off in the distance, then?
If only anything could change you
If only you knew what you claim to
If only every sign you cling to
If only they were so
Tune any eye into the ivy
And I won't bleed out if I know me
All I need oh don't deny me
You ended up too strained
Oh, I would lead it in the morning
Oh I won't even if I know it
All I need oh don't deny me
We're in the eye sometimes
Too young, too
Too young, too"
29,Fool's Errand,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832326/Fleet+Foxes/Fool%27s+Errand,"I knew you fine, sight dream of mine
But I know my eyes, they've often lied
And I move like blood, like fire and flood
Despite you

Blind love couldn't win
As the facts all came in
But I know I'll again chase after wind
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sight comes to mind
A fool's errand

Life will repeat, vision I see
The mouth and the teeth
That's fine with me
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sign comes to mind
A fool's errand

But I can make it through
I was thin and I saw life in you
Fool's errand"
30,I Should See Memphis,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832325/Fleet+Foxes/I+Should+See+Memphis,"Endless vacation
Felt like perdition
Sybarite woman
Stood at attention
Pacing the basement, like Cassius in Rome
Or in Kinshasa
""Just let me at him""
Like First Manassas
Like Appomattox
I've got my teeth in it
I won't let go

But I gave you no option
Illusion of choosing
And if you wouldn't stop them
Then you just hate losing

I miss the highway
I should see Memphis
She sees it my way
Her and Osiris"
31,Crack-Up,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832324/Fleet+Foxes/Crack-Up,"So the mind won't lie
And the arm won't set
And the bright red eye isn't off you yet
So the words won't come
And the hand won't touch
And a midnight sun doesn't look like much
As an iris contracts, facing the day
I can tell you've cracked
Like a china plate

When the world insists
That the false is so
With a philippic as Cicero
""The tighter the fist
The looser the sand""

If I don't resist
Will I understand?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

All things change
Dividing tide far as I can see
All fades through but my light of you, as Ylajali

All I see, dividing tide
Rising over me
Ooh, wait
Oh, will you wait?
You, alive
You, alive
You, alive"

33,Cassius,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832322/Fleet+Foxes/Cassius,"Past my window, out in the street
Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue, the useless sirens scream

The song of masses, passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire, blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I, out into the night
Held within the line that they've drawn

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Oh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son, and a daughter
Oh, are we also tamed?

I walked home, no words to say
Cassius, one month gone on his way
And who will lead us and who remains to die?
By a thread, drop my head to cry

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son, and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh"
34,"Naiads, Cassadies",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832321/Fleet+Foxes/Naiads%2C+Cassadies,"Who stole the life from you?
Who turned you so against you?
Who was the thief who shaved your teeth
Accepting just virtue
Ooh

And did he act alone?
Were any more complicit?
When he would sing and offer the ring
What older voice said, ""kiss it""?
Ooh

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Fire can't doubt its heat
Water can't doubt its power
You're not adrift, you're not a gift
You know you're not a flower"
35,Kept Woman,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832320/Fleet+Foxes/Kept+Woman,"Anna, you're lost in a shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be bolder than me
I was high, I was unaware

God above saw, ever in the mind
Blue and white irises in a line
Under your nameless shame
I left you in frame, and you rose to be ossified
As a rose of the oceanside
Too long to the light of the morning
So unseen, as light in a dream
Too long now to the rising
Too long now to the rising

Can you be slow for a little while?
Widow your soul for another mile?
I'm just the same as when you saw me back then
And we're bound to be reconciled
And we're bound to be reconciled
Too long swinging in the night
All will wash over you in a night so unending
Not long now to the rising
Not long now to the rising

Anna, you're lost in the shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be bolder than me
I was high, I was unaware"
36,Third of May/Odaigahara,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832319/Fleet+Foxes/Third+of+May-Odaigahara,"Light ended the night, but the song remained
And I was hiding by the stair
Half here, half there, past the lashing rain
And as the sky would petal white, old innocent lies came to mind
As we stood, congregated, at the firing line

Night ended the fight, but the song remained
And so I headed to the wall
Turned tail to call to the new domain
As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free
But it's all the same
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow? 
Did you change overnight?
Second son, on the other line

Now, back in our town as a castaway
I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May
As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow? 
Did I change overnight?
Second son, for the second time

Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?

But all will fade
All I say
All I needed
As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded

Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it
And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it

I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing
Hold fast to the wing"
37,"If You Need to, Keep Time on Me",https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832318/Fleet+Foxes/If+You+Need+to%2C+Keep+Time+on+Me,"How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what state is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

Wide oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes heatless fire

But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me"
38,Mearcstapa,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832317/Fleet+Foxes/Mearcstapa,"Two lines in the air
Two eyes on the pair
Mearcstapa, on an open sea
But you turn away
No falling today
No wind in the night
You're putting slack in the lines

The eyes of the sea
So easy to meet
Mearcstapa, deaf and blind like me
And the foam doesn't sing
The phone doesn't ring
So what will you find
Mearcstapa of mine?"
39,On Another Ocean (January/June),https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832316/Fleet+Foxes/On+Another+Ocean+%28January-June%29,"Biding your time on the other ocean
Falling into line in the cold and damp

Wherever you run, you see all you leave behind you
Lies inside
Anyone you open on the other ocean
On the other ocean, on the other ocean

Was he not quite as you had conceived him?
Did the color of the light hide the fight in the eye?

Wherever you run, you see only eyes behind you
Lies inside
Anyone you open
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean

So, do you think the smoke, it won't enfold you?
Or there'll be someone waiting for you?
Off in the distance, then?
If only anything could change you
If only you knew what you claim to
If only every sign you cling to
If only they were so
Tune any eye into the ivy
And I won't bleed out if I know me
All I need oh don't deny me
You ended up too strained
Oh, I would lead it in the morning
Oh I won't even if I know it
All I need oh don't deny me
We're in the eye sometimes
Too young, too
Too young, too"
40,Fool's Errand,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832315/Fleet+Foxes/Fool%27s+Errand,"I knew you fine, sight dream of mine
But I know my eyes, they've often lied
And I move like blood, like fire and flood
Despite you

Blind love couldn't win
As the facts all came in
But I know I'll again chase after wind
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sight comes to mind
A fool's errand

Life will repeat, vision I see
The mouth and the teeth
That's fine with me
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sign comes to mind
A fool's errand

But I can make it through
I was thin and I saw life in you
Fool's errand"
41,I Should See Memphis,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832314/Fleet+Foxes/I+Should+See+Memphis,"Endless vacation
Felt like perdition
Sybarite woman
Stood at attention
Pacing the basement, like Cassius in Rome
Or in Kinshasa
""Just let me at him""
Like First Manassas
Like Appomattox
I've got my teeth in it
I won't let go

But I gave you no option
Illusion of choosing
And if you wouldn't stop them
Then you just hate losing

I miss the highway
I should see Memphis
She sees it my way
Her and Osiris"
42,Crack-Up,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/33832313/Fleet+Foxes/Crack-Up,"So the mind won't lie
And the arm won't set
And the bright red eye isn't off you yet
So the words won't come
And the hand won't touch
And a midnight sun doesn't look like much
As an iris contracts, facing the day
I can tell you've cracked
Like a china plate

When the world insists
That the false is so
With a philippic as Cicero
""The tighter the fist
The looser the sand""

If I don't resist
Will I understand?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

All things change
Dividing tide far as I can see
All fades through but my light of you, as Ylajali

All I see, dividing tide
Rising over me
Ooh, wait
Oh, will you wait?
You, alive
You, alive
You, alive"

I was following the, I was following the, I was following the, I was following the

I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from falling in the snow, and I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime

I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from falling in the snow, and I turned 'round and there you go
And Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime

Oh how could I dream of such a selfless and true love
Could I wash my hands of
Just looking out for me

Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me
Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me

In dearth or in excess
Both the slave and the empress
Will return to the dirt I guess, naked as when they came

I wonder if I'll see any faces above me
Or just cracks in the ceiling
Nobody else to blame

Oh man what I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me
Oh man that I used to be
Oh man oh my oh me

Gold teeth and gold jewelry
Every piece of your dowry
Throw them into the tomb with me
Bury them with my name

Unless I have someday
Ran my wandering mind away

Oh man what I used to be
Montezuma to Tripoli
Oh man oh my oh me"

49,Mykonos,https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/29489118/Fleet+Foxes/Mykonos,"The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us
Footsteps follow, down through the hollow sound, torn up.

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made

How did animals in the snow tipped pines, I find
Hatching from the seed of your thin mind, all night?

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made

Brother you don't need to turn me away
I was waiting down at the ancient gate

You go
Wherever you go today
You go today

I remember how they took you down
As the winter turned the meadow brown

You go
Wherever you go today
You go today

When a-walking brother don't you forget
It ain't often that you'll ever find a friend

You go
Wherever you go today
You go today"

I have borrowed all my lonesome life
And I can't, no I can't get through
The borrower's debt is the only regret of my youth

And believe me it's not easy when I look back
Everything I took got soon returned
Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern

Just to be at Innisfree again
All of the sirens are driving me over the stern

One day at Innisfree
One day that's mine there

In the street one day I saw you among the crowd
In a geometric pattern dressed
Gleaming white just as I recall
Old as I get I will never forget it at all
Gleaming white just as I recall
Old as I get I could never forget it at all

One day at Innisfree
One day that's mine there"

Lighting a match on the suitcase's latch in the fading of night

Ruffle the fur of the collie 'neath the table
Ran out the door through the dark
Carved out his initials in the bark

Then the Earth shook, that was all that it took for the dream to break
All the loose ends would surround me again in the shape of your face

What makes me love you despite the reservations?
What do I see in your eyes
Besides my reflection hanging high?

Are you off somewhere reciting incantations?
Sim sala bim on your tongue
Carving off the hair of someone's young

Remember when you had me cut your hair?
Call me Delilah then I wouldn't care"

All my fingers rotten
I woke up a dying man without a chance

I came to your window
Threw a stone and waited
At the door a stranger stood
The stranger's voice said nothing good
I turned to walk the frozen ground alone
All the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn

Both my eyes are fading
No light in the evening
Planted like a seed in sand and drowned in rain

Watch you for an hour
He kept you beneath him
He kept you on lock and key
He paid the wage you sent to me
And waste the day so idly alone
All the way home

Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn
Wide-eyed walker
Do not wander
Do not wander
Through the dawn"

Just as the tar seeps up from the ground
Bitter dancer, ever turning
So was the day that you came to town

You took a room and you settled in
Washed off the chalk from your weathered skin
Daylight sleeper
Bloody reaper
You took a room and you settled in

I should have known one day you would come
All of us walk so blind in the sun
Midnight feeder, beggar pleader
I should have known one day you would come

Tell me again my only son
Tell me again what have you done

At arm's length
I will hold you there
There

At arm's length
I will hold you there
There"

Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes, unique in each way you can see
And now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be
A functioning cog in some great machinery serving something beyond me

But I don't, I don't know what that will be
I'll get back to you someday soon you will see

What's my name, what's my station, oh, just tell me what I should do
I don't need to be kind to the armies of night that would do such injustice to you
Or bow down and be grateful and say ""Sure, take all that you see""
To the men who move only in dimly-lit halls and determine my future for me

And I don't, I don't know who to believe
I'll get back to you someday soon you will see

If I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see
Of the world outside is so inconceivable often I barely can speak
Yeah I'm tongue-tied and dizzy and I can't keep it to myself
What good is it to sing helplessness blues, why should I wait for anyone else?

And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf
I'll come back to you someday soon myself

If I had an orchard, I'd work 'til I'm raw
If I had an orchard, I'd work 'til I'm sore
And you would wait tables and soon run the store

Gold hair in the sunlight, my light in the dawn
If I had an orchard, I'd work 'til I'm sore
If I had an orchard, I'd work 'til I'm sore
Someday I'll be like the man on the screen"
